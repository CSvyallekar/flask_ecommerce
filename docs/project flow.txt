Step 1:
Open flask_ecommerce/__init__.py
Import "from flask import Flask" and then create a function "create_app".
Define a variable "app" and assign "Flask(__name__)". It creates flask application object. It must have "return app" in the same function(create_app)

Step 2:
app.py is the main file of the project that exectues flask project.
Import the "create_app" function from "flask/ecommerce/__init__.py" into "app.py". Create a variable app and assign "create_app()". At the end of the file, define app.run() to execute the project.

Step 3:
Open your views.py file to create blueprint & routes. It also have business logic.
Import inbuilt classes such as Blueprint, jsonify, request from flask.
Initialize the blueprint object named as "mod". It is optional to define "url_prefix".
Blueprint names must be unique for different apps.
Every URL/Rest api must have a decorater"@mod.route" and create a function for the same.
Method names are "POST, PUT, DELETE, GET".
It must return "jsonify" response or "string" response.

Step 4:
Register the created blueprint into "create_app" function of the "flask_ecommerce/__init__.py".


(For Configuration)

Step 5:
Create a "config.py" file for development and production configuration/servers.
It must contains "SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI" and "SECRET_KEY".

Step 6:
Use the configuration name into "create_app" function. It will be get stored into your configuration of the flask application which is "app" variable.


(For Database connectivity)

Step 7: 
Create variable "db" object of "SQLALCHEMY" into file "flask_ecommerce/__init__.py".
Now, assign or intialize the "db" object with flask application named as "app" object into "create_app" function.

Step 8:
Open/Create a file "models.py" and create a table class(User) and its fields/columns/class variables.

Step 9:
Open the "views.py" file and import "db" object of SQLALCHEMY and write your SQL queries/code for the routes/api.
